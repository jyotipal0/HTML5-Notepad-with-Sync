# HTML5 Notepad App

Please [see the updated and modern version of the notepad](http://sources.vsta.org:7100/notepad/index) created by [Andy Valencia](https://github.com/vandys).


## Installation

1. Upload files to your server.
2. Rename `entries` folder to something random and harder to guess.
3. Make that folder writable (CHMOD 0777).
4. Edit `sync.php` and specify your new `DATA_DIR` (the one you just renamed).
5. In `sync.php` change username and password to something unique.
6. Finally Done!
